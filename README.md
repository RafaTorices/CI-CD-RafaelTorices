# CI-CD-RafaelTorices

Repository for the CI/CD subject of the module KeepCoding DevOps Bootcamp

## Description

This repository contains a simple application written in **Python** that uses the **Flask** framework. The application is a simple **_calculator web application_** with various operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power). The application is deployed in a **Kubernetes cluster** using **ArgoCD**. The application is automated using **CircleCI**. The application is tested using **pytest** and the coverage is calculated using **pytest-cov**. The application is linted using **pylint** and **flake8**. Also, the static code analysis is done using **SonarCloud**. All these tools have been used to create a CI/CD pipeline for the application.

The repository uses the Gitflow workflow. The repository branches:

- **main**: Contains the stable code of the application.
- **develop**: Contains the code in development of the application.
- **release**: Contains the code of the releases of the application.

## CI/CD pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is created using CircleCI. The pipeline definition is in the **.circleci/config.yml** file. In resume, the pipeline has the following steps:

- **Executors**: docker
- **Jobs**:

  - **app-build**: Build the application.
  - **app-test**: Testing the application.
  - **app-docs**: Generate the documentation of the application.
  - **app-release**: Release the application.
  - **app-deploy**: Deploy the application.

- **workflows**: app-workflow

  - **app-build**: Build the application.
  - **app-test**: Requires build. Test the application.
  - **app-docs**: Requires build. Generate the documentation of the application.
  - **app-release**: Requires build, test and docs. Release the application.
  - **app-deploy**: Requires build. Deploy the application.

- **artifacts**: Generated by the jobs.

  - **app-test**: The test coverage xml and html of the application.
  - **app-docs**: The documentation html of the application.
  - **app-release**: The package tar.gz of the application.
  - **app-deploy**: The package dockerhub of the application.
